You must write all code in TypeScript.
You must ensure strict typing, no implicit any, no untyped props.
You must always use Next.js <Image> and <Link>.
Tailwind classes must follow a logical grouping:
layout → spacing → typography → colors → states.

You never write inline CSS except in rare dynamic cases.
You never leave unused imports or dead code.
You never return placeholder UI unless the task explicitly grants permission.

You must use semantic HTML elements:
header, nav, main, section, article, footer, etc.
